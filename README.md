# Learning activities and resources
This week, I dedicated my focus to learning how to use WordPress to design and publish website-related child themes. I successfully set up a child theme specifically for creating a website using WordPress and made it accessible online. Additionally, I explored various plugins that can enhance website functionality, such as contact form plugins, and discovered visually appealing themes to enhance the overall design of the website. I also delved into the process of customizing theme names to align with specific branding requirements. Furthermore, I studied website design templates to gain insights into creating visually appealing and user-friendly websites.

In addition to my focus on WordPress, I also want to mention that I continued my exploration of Joomla, as it is another popular content management system similar to WordPress. I reviewed Joomla tutorials provided by SiteGround, watched YouTube tutorials on building websites with Joomla, and further familiarized myself with Joomla's installation process and template customization options. While my primary focus this week was on WordPress, I believe that having a broader understanding of both WordPress and Joomla will be beneficial for our group assignments and future website development projects.

These methods can be valuable for adding finer details when building websites in the future.
