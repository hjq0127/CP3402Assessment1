# Learning activities and resources
This week, I focused on how to use WordPress to design and publish website-related child themes. I set up a child theme specifically to make a website using wordpress and make it accessible online. At the same time, I also searched for some plug-ins, similar to how to insert contact from and some good-looking patterns, as well as changes to the theme name. I also studied website design templates. I believe that a thorough understanding of the subtopics will be helpful in our group assignments.

# Estimated Time
I spent approximately 6 hours of personal time this week studying this sub-theme, including the time spent on the Assessment1.
# Insights on Content
WordPress themes provide a starting base for creating a website and simplify many coding aspects, especially when it comes to using the tool. It helped me build a simple website quickly without having to start from scratch. Through this week’s study, I gained confidence in building websites using WordPress. I learned how to create a website using WordPress, different ways to present a website, and explored the various website templates available. Overall, this experience enhanced my understanding of how to publish a website using WordPress.
# Insights on Career/Employment/Learning
After completing the practical exercises, I started watching YouTube courses on the topic of WordPress to explore additional insights that may not have been covered in the practical exercises alone. I discovered alternative ways to utilize controls in web design, particularly in relation to adding images. I learned that adding images is not limited to embedding them within articles; there are other techniques such as direct image addition and using URLs to create super links with images. These methods can be valuable for adding finer details when building websites in the future.

Based on my study strategy this week, I found that reading the WordPress guide, completing the exercises, and then revisiting the tutorial videos worked well for me. However, I recognize the need for more practice and the importance of seeking additional resources beyond videos to deepen my understanding. By diversifying my learning sources and exploring more materials, I can gain a more comprehensive understanding of WordPress and refine my skills in website development.
